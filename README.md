## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Python 3.10 or newer** ([Download here](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
- **pip** (Python package installer)
- **Git** (for cloning the repository)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/NgTHung/Wordling.git
    cd Wordling
    ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   
   **On macOS/Linux:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
   
   **On Windows:**
   ```cmd
   python -m venv .venv
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Apply database migrations:**
   
   This will create the database schema and automatically load the word list from `words_alpha.txt`:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. **Create a superuser (optional, for admin access):**
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

6. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

7. **Access the application:**
   - **Web Interface:** [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/)
   - **API Root:** [http://localhost:8000/api/](http://localhost:8000/api/)
   - **Admin Panel:** [http://localhost:8000/admin/](http://localhost:8000/admin/) (requires superuser)

|----------|---------|----------------|-------------|
| `/api/` | `GET` | None | API root with endpoint links |
| `/api/games/` | `GET`, `POST` | Session | List all games or create a new game |
| `/api/games/<id>/` | `GET`, `PATCH` | Session | Retrieve or update a specific game |
| `/api/guesses/` | `GET`, `POST` | Session | List guesses or submit a new guess |
| `/api/guesses/<id>/` | `GET` | Session | Retrieve a specific guess |
| `/api/users/` | `GET` | None | List all registered users |
| `/api/users/<id>/` | `GET` | None | Retrieve a specific user's profile |
| `/api/giveup/` | `GET` | Session | Forfeit current game and reveal the solution |

### Example API Requests

**Create a new game:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/games/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --cookie "sessionid=YOUR_SESSION_ID"
```

**Submit a guess:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/guesses/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"word": "hello"}' \
  --cookie "sessionid=YOUR_SESSION_ID"
```

**Response format for guess:**
```json
{
  "result": "GYBBB"

## How to Play

1. **Visit the homepage** and click "Play" or register for an account to track your stats
2. **Guess the 5-letter word** in 6 tries or fewer
3. **Observe the color feedback:**
   - ðŸŸ© **Green** = Letter is in the word and in the correct position
   - ðŸŸ¨ **Yellow** = Letter is in the word but in the wrong position
   - â¬œ **Gray** = Letter is not in the word at all
4. **Use the feedback** to make more informed guesses
5. **Win by guessing the word** before running out of attempts!

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue:** `ImportError: No module named 'rest_framework'`
- **Solution:** Make sure you've activated your virtual environment and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

**Issue:** Database migration errors
- **Solution:** Delete `db.sqlite3` and rerun `python manage.py migrate`

**Issue:** Words not loading
- **Solution:** Ensure `api/words_alpha.txt` exists and run the migration `0004_Populate_words.py`

**Issue:** CSRF verification failed
- **Solution:** Ensure cookies are enabled and you're using the same domain for API calls
